# Roadmap for Burger Space Invaders Game

## Overview
This project is a web-based, retro/8-bit style version of Space Invaders where the invaders are burgers and the player shoots ketchup and mustard. The game will use the classic formation movement for the enemies and will be developed with modern front-end strategies using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. This roadmap covers the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first—with the basic game loop, movement, and shooting mechanics—and then outlines future enhancements (such as scoring, lives, increasing difficulty, and power-ups).

## Phase 1: MVP Development

### 1. Requirements & Planning (MVP)
- **Core Features:**
  - Player movement (left/right) and shooting (projectiles: ketchup and mustard).
  - Burger invaders move in the original formation pattern.
  - Basic collision detection between projectiles and burger enemies.
- **Exclusions (for MVP):**
  - No scoring system or lives.
  - No increasing difficulty.
  - No power-ups.
  - No audio.
- **Technology Stack:**
  - HTML5 Canvas for rendering.
  - Vanilla JavaScript following modern ES6+ practices.
  - CSS for basic styling.
- **Design:**
  - Retro/8bit style graphics for burgers, projectiles, and the game background.
  - Responsive layout to support different desktop resolutions.

### 2. Project Setup
- **Initialize the Project:**
  - Create the project folder structure with separate folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets (sprites, images).
  - Set up a basic HTML file with a Canvas element.
- **Development Environment:**
  - Configure a local development server (e.g., using VS Code Live Server or similar).
  - Initialize a Git repository for version control.

### 3. Core Game Engine
- **Game Loop:**
  - Implement a main game loop using `requestAnimationFrame`.
  - Establish a simple state management system (e.g., game start, playing, paused, game over).
- **Player Mechanics:**
  - Draw the player entity on the Canvas.
  - Implement movement controls (keyboard events for left/right movement).
  - Implement shooting mechanics for ketchup and mustard projectiles.
- **Enemy (Burger Invaders):**
  - Create sprite(s) for burger enemies.
  - Arrange enemies in a formation and implement movement patterns (sideways and descending when reaching screen edges).
- **Collision Detection:**
  - Set up basic collision detection between projectiles and burger sprites.
  - Remove or “destroy” burger enemies when hit.

### 4. Rendering & Graphics
- **Canvas Drawing:**
  - Render all game entities (player, burgers, projectiles) on the Canvas.
  - Apply retro/8bit styling to all graphics.
- **Asset Integration:**
  - Create or source simple 8-bit style graphics.
  - Ensure assets are optimized for web performance.

### 5. Testing & Debugging (MVP)
- **Initial Playtesting:**
  - Manually test player controls, enemy movement, and collisions.
- **Bug Fixing:**
  - Debug issues related to movement, rendering, and collision detection.
- **Refinement:**
  - Fine-tune the game loop for smooth animations and responsive controls.

## Phase 2: Post-MVP Enhancements

### 1. Gameplay Enhancements
- **Scoring System:**
  - Implement a score counter that increases as burgers are hit.
- **Lives:**
  - Add a lives counter for the player.
- **Increasing Difficulty:**
  - Introduce difficulty scaling over time (e.g., faster enemy movement or additional rows of invaders).

### 2. Additional Features
- **Power-Ups:**
  - Design and implement power-ups that provide temporary bonuses (e.g., faster shooting, temporary invincibility).
- **Enhanced UI:**
  - Create detailed start, pause, and game-over screens with retro graphics.
  - Add in-game overlays for score, lives, and power-up status.

### 3. Optimization & Polishing
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimize game loop and asset loading for smoother performance.
- **Visual & UX Enhancements:**
  - Polish retro/8bit graphics and animations.
  - Ensure the game scales well on various desktop sizes.
- **Code Refactoring:**
  - Clean up and document code for maintainability.
  - Prepare for potential future expansions (e.g., mobile responsive design).

### 4. Final Testing & Deployment
- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - Perform rigorous testing including edge cases and user feedback sessions.
- **Deployment:**
  - Finalize local deployment.
  - Optionally, prepare for hosting the game on a web server or GitHub Pages.
